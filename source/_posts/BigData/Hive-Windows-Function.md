PTF
in Place Table Function?
Table in --> Table out

is the content after 'over' input?

Input is partitioned (optionally ordered)
An instance of a PTF operates on a Partition
Partitioning drives parallel execution

Similar to MR, predate to MapReduce

why?
Aggerations by Partition -> Rank, top N
Inter row Calculation -> Time series analysis
Multi Pass Algorithm
Graph Algorithm --> implement recursive.

Example: Market  Basket Analysis? 

functions:
LAG: 对每一行记录的向上的第N个记录。 没有就设为DEAFULT， LAG(col, n, DEFAULT)
LEAD: 对每一行记录取向下的第N个记录。

First_value
Last_value

要指定order by
