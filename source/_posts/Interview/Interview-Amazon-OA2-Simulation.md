Work Simulation

<!-- 目前两大原则:1.requirement排在第一，deadline第二，林丹不能出轨第 三。2.有manager出现的选项无脑选manager，manager就是一个组的代言 人+保护伞，大哥自己人. -->

第一个视频题 电子书API
第一个情境是给图书馆写图书推荐系统，关于book api的题目 第一问让两个人继续说 大约是两个人在对一个项目发表不同的观点。
感觉选择tell me more的选项是最正确的 因为一开始基本上只是那两个人在强调自己是对的。
你选了tell me more之后他会具体告诉你他们 在说什么。我当时选了其中的一个人得观点，结果后面接的就是“等等他还不知道全部的信息”然 后他就继续把其他你需要知道的信息告诉你 

第二问选图书馆的服务器有没有开放关于实体书的api 一是两个小哥讨论图书推荐的API应该自己做还是用现成的。
自己做的API涵盖面广但是due赶不 上了，别人做的只有电子书，但是可以赶上due，就是明年才能涵盖纸质书。 book api那道选的deadline 
俩个年轻老白讨论客人要强烈要求有硬皮书的推荐，但服务器里只有digital版本的，到底要不要 加这个功能，感觉后面的视频是根据你的选择来的（有待考证） 


估计项目开发时间
一上来菜鸟Ben说，咱们有个项目，都没做过，不知道能不能赶上due，这 时候要怎么估计开发的进度(时间)。
Manager放5，
找有经验的人请教4， 
上网查资料或是先做一段时间再估计都放3，
还有其他裸上的就1吧。


一个项目时间表设计

安排会议

两周做四周的活

搞个数据库
Senior:
I am an expert in metric generation and have set up the database we will be using. 
I have done lots of queries on the database so I could really help here. 
I will not be available until the middle of next week, but with my help you might be able to finish in two weeks. 
Ben: 
I am not very familiar with this database and don't have much experience in metric generation. 
Working together, we might be able to do this in two weeks. 
Keep in mind I don't know as much about this as Priya, so we will have to be extra careful to make sure everything works correctly. 

Please rate the effectiveness of each response option for meeting the deadline. 
A. Work on the project on your own. putting in extra effort to finish on time.  **2 - Slightly Effective** 
B. Work on the project on your own until Priya is available. then continue to work on it together. **3 - Moderately Effective.**
C. Work on the project with Ben being sure to watch his work closely because of his lack of experience **3 - Moderately Effective.**
D. Tell your manager you will not be able to complete the project in the time available. **1 - Ineffective** 
E. Cut features from the product so you will be able to meet the two week deadline. **1 - ineffective** 
F. Start working on the project right away with Ben Then ask Priya to contribute what **5 - Hightly Effective**

Hi Team. 
As you know. our Retail Website Team client has asked t indexing service. They requested a feature allowing us tc purchased.

I think we should perform the upgrade. As a compromise. we can include the gift recommendation feature the Retail Website Team wants by the deadline and then complete the upgrade. We can finish the seasonal-based gift recommendations feature after the deadline. 4

I think we should perform the upgrade. The right thing to do is push back on the Retail Website Team because it will allow us to more efficiently serve the customer and the customer will be helped in the long run.

We should not perform this upgrade at this point in time. Our top focus is meeting our agreed upon commitment with the Retail Website Team. so we should finish that first. We can focus on the upgrade afterwards by pushing out deadlines for some of our other projects. 

We should not perform this upgrade at this point in time. We promised the Retail Website Team we would have their new features complete by the proposed deadline. Let's postpone the upgrade to another time 

I think we should perform the upgrade' The right thing to do is push back on the Retail Website Team because it will keep our team from having to do the same work twice. 1

We should not perform the upgrade because it will not have a significant impact on the Retail Website Team's experience We should focus on the Retail Website Team's requests 


推荐系统有抱怨
15 Customer Complaints on Recommendation Service
Priya Senior SDE
We have been receiving a lot of customer complaints over the past three days about problems on pages related to your new Recommendation feature. It is likely being caused by one of the three services you’re using. There have been no recent updates to the services and we have ruled out all external factors. This issue is affecting customers, resulting in our product order rate dropping. We really need to solve this as quickly as possible. The reporting team generated an error report(see attached), let me know what you think.
Thanks,
Priya
Based on the data in the Error Rate over Time report, how would you respond? Please select only one response option.
Identify Service 1 as the problem
Identify Service 2 as the problem
Identify Service 3 as the problem
I think Service 1 is the problem, but I would like to see another report to confirm 
I think Service 2 is the problem, but I would like to see another report to confirm
I think Service 3 is the problem, but I would like to see another report to confirm 
I dont know which service is the problem. I want to request another report to get additional information.

选I think Service 3 is the problem, but I would like to see another report to confirm， service 3 一直在涨
这题有视频，一个经理讲咱最近服务器总是挂，什么情况?
先选看internal bug的记录。
给了一张图，3个service最近表现，service 3最近几天一直在涨。
选I think service 3 is the problem, but I would like to see another report to confirm。 然后一个印度工程师说自己写了20年server，绝对不会错。选项纠结点在 于，这边我来查，那边他查不查，虽然我倾向于选让他也查，但是这次选他 不查。那个著名的he is not helpful就不要选了吧。 接下来的题目是，既然这次捅了这么大的篓子，那么应该怎么痛定思痛呢， 这题原则就是能自己解决就别麻烦别人。 增加开发过程中测试的时间/测试覆盖更多case，放5

新产品设计

Hi 
For the new social network integration product, Ravi is the senior engineer and Jane is the product manager. To help us decide what features to include in the time we have, I asked Ravi to estimate the time to develop each feature and I asked Jane to provide a rough prioritization of each feature. I put their responses in a chart on the Wiki. The file is named "Social Network Integration Design." I'm really swamped today so can you take a look at the chart and give me your recommendation for what features we should include? We have 8 weeks to get something up and running. 
Thanks, Nadia

A,C,F
A,C,D,G,H

规则是有high先high，low的尽量不做，按照次序来比较。
所以最佳的是 FG，之后都是A开头，那就挑，ABD第二，ADF第三，ACF第四，ACDG和 ACDGH，
按照requirement的话，应该把ACDGH放在最下面，H是low。维持原判，能high就high。

代码分析
17 Last part of code
Aaron
Here’s the last bit of code for the social network project. The code snippet is attached to this email. Sorry this took so long to finish, but it turned out to be more difficult than I thought. Can you just give it a quick check to make sure everything looks okay? I’m leaving for the day, so I’ll see you at the demonstration in the morning! Thanks!
What is the problem with the Product.wasPurchasedByUser() method? Please select only one response option.
A. It will run slowly because algorithm complexity is O(n^2)
B. It will run slowly on large datasets because more than one user could have purchased the same product.
C. It will run slowly because algorithm complexity is O(n^3)
D. It has performance issues.
选最长

What is the most effective way of improving the ShoppingCart() class for the long term? Please select only one response option. ? 

A. ShoppingCart should not override the user property every time new product is added to it.
B. Make ShoppingCart a property of Product class to improve performance.
C. Change the design of ShoppingCart by removing ShoppingCart.user and making shopping cart a property of User instead.
D. Product should have getUser() method so that we know what user has added it to his/her shopping cart.
选最长

Please indicate whether the five tests within the ShoppingCartTest() class would pass or fail. Assume each unit test is independent of the others. Please provide a response for each test.

Test1
fail
Assert.assertTrue user1.getDefaultPaymentMethod().getIsDefault();
getDefaultPaymentMethod() 返回 null

Test2
pass
PaymentMethod method1 = new
PaymentMethod(PaymentMethodType.CREDIT_CARD, “myPersonalCard”, true);
Assert.assertSame method1, user1.getDefaultPaymentMethod()

Test3
pass
Assert.assertEquals Bob user2.getName()
fail
Assert.assertEquals alice@foo.com user1.getEmail()
构造函数有四个参数但是函数里只给其中三个赋值里，email 没有赋值。
    
Test4
pass
Assert.assertSame(thumbnail, myProduct.getImages().get(0))

Test5
fail
Assert.assertTrue(10.75 == product.getPrice());
有一个 setPrice 方法有一个 overload， 一个参数是int， 一个参数是 double，所以 double 会被转型为 int
setPrice 可以是 double 或者  integer， 但是 getPrice 是返回 integer

误解Deadline

Hi Nadia. 

It looks like there has been a miscommunication. Unfortunately, the Customer Incentives Team is dependent on your piece of this project in order for us to begin our piece. For the project to still meet the stakeholder timeline. we will need your team to complete your section in the next one week rather than two weeks. I hope this doesn't cause too much of a problem. 
Best regards. 

Please rate the effectiveness of each response option for completing this work on time: 

Ask your whole team for help. explaining the urgency that another team is blocked. **5- Highly Effective**

Work with the Customer Incentives Team to identify the critical features that they need by the deadline, and focus on those. **4 - Very Effective**

Push the timeline back another week to ensure there is enough time for all work to be completed accurately.  **1 - Ineffective**

Ask your ntinager for help in determining the best approach to meet the new deadline. **4 - Very Effective**

Put in extra hours yourself to make sure everything gets done on time. **3 - Moderately Effective**
